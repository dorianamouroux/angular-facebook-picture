# angular-facebook-picture

## Description

That project was a test I had to do for an internship near San Francisco.
I did it in one full day of work, unfortunately I didn't get the job, but I'm proud enough to put it on GitHub.
I used Materialize for the design.

## How it works

So it's a client for viewing your Facebook's albums and pictures, build with Angular 1.
You need a http file server (I used this one : https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
In the file /src/app.js you have to put your Facebook AppIp (line 8).
You need to create your application on Facebook Developers obviously (https://developers.facebook.com).
The redirection url must be the index page (mine is http://localhost:8080/)
